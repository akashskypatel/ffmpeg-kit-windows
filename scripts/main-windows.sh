  Welcome to the ffmpeg cross-compile builder-helper script.
  Downloads and builds will be installed to directories within $cur_dir
  If this is not ok, then exit now, and cd to the directory where you'd
  like them installed, then run this script again from there.
  NB that once you build your compilers, you can no longer rename/move
  the $sandbox directory, since it will have some hard coded paths in there.
  You can, of course, rebuild ffmpeg from within it, etc.
